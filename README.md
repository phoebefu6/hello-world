# hello-world
this is my first github repository


this is the second revision of readme file. it is used to test out code patching functions, good luck!


this is the third edition of the readme file, to test out pull requests. 

this is amended by creating a new branch for readme edits, and use this to pull requests and merge back to the main branch. 

haha I just remove one line from the code, you guest which line it is? and where can you get it? allallalallala
